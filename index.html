        <P>Being big can be very beneficial when living in the wild. If you are large enough, then few predators will be able to overpower you, making you relatively safe. Throughout the animal kingdom are examples of where evolution has turned to size and strength to provide protection, resulting in some truly gigantic species. One of the finest examples of this is the mighty elephant. By far the largest land animal on Planet Earth, elephants are just too big for predators to take on. While their young may be vulnerable, they are protected by the adults in the herd. Adult elephants are not only powerful, but can be very aggressive if threatened, meaning itâ€™s best to keep well clear.
            Elephants are also very intelligent creatures and live in complex social groups. In tight-knit communities, a herd will often contain several generations with the females being in charge. They appear to mourn their dead and show other behavior that indicates strong cognitive abilities. Unfortunately, excessive hunting means that we are at risk of losing them altogether. These impressive beasts have long fascinated mankind and have been the subject of many studies. We have learned a great deal about them, including many interesting facts.</P>
